# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the canonical glossary plus the authority map
  naming which repo and which file wins when two sources disagree.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read the ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

Single-context repo: one root `CONTEXT.md`, one flat `docs/adr/`. There is no
`CONTEXT-MAP.md` and no per-context ADR directory.

The `domain-modeling` skill creates and extends these lazily, when terms or decisions
actually get resolved — not upfront.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `domain-modeling`).

The glossary's `_Avoid_` lines are load-bearing: several record collisions checked against the literature corpus, so a "clearer" synonym may be one this project deliberately rejected.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (quantization policy lives in `quantization_planner.py`) — but worth reopening because…_

Some ADRs record constraints a change **cannot** override without invalidating
experiments already run — the freeze (ADR-0010), the bit-exactness gate (ADR-0006),
and the frozen `conf/` files. Treat a contradiction with those as a stop, not a flag.
